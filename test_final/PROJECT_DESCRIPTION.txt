- Improve patient care quality through proactive planning
- Reduce operational costs by preventing over/under-staffing
- Enhance emergency department efficiency and capacity management

The project addresses a critical challenge in healthcare management: predicting 
fluctuating patient demand patterns to ensure adequate resources are available 
when needed most.

1.2 Overall Concept

The system operates on the principle of predictive analytics applied to 
healthcare operations. It collects real-time patient arrival data, analyzes 
historical patterns, and uses machine learning models to forecast future demand.

Core Concept Flow:
1. Data Collection: Real-time patient arrival events (simulated or real)
2. Data Processing: Aggregation and feature engineering
3. Pattern Analysis: Identification of temporal patterns (hourly, daily, weekly)
4. Forecasting: Machine learning models predict future arrivals
5. Visualization: Interactive dashboard displays insights and predictions
6. Decision Support: Enables data-driven resource planning

The system is designed as a web-based dashboard that provides:
- Real-time monitoring of current ED status

- Data transformation (patient records to time-series format)
- Merging and joining operations for combining data sources
- Built-in time manipulation (datetime parsing, time-based grouping)

Impact on Project:
Without Pandas: Would require manual data manipulation, complex time handling, 
and inefficient data processing - making real-time analytics impractical.

With Pandas: Efficient processing of thousands of patient records with 
complex time-based operations in seconds.
